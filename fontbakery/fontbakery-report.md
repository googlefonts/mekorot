* [com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This
list is updated regularly and is indexed by a 4-char &quot;Vendor ID&quot; which is stored
in the achVendID field of the OS/2 table.
Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some
applications may display the type designer / type foundry contact info on some
dialog and also because that info will be visible on Microsoft&#x27;s website:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/
This check verifies whether or not a given font&#x27;s vendor ID is registered in
that list or if it has some of the default values used by the most common font
editors.
Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs.
If you registered recently, you&#x27;re safe to ignore warnings emitted by this
check, since your ID will soon be included in one of our upcoming releases.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** OS/2 VendorID value 'NONE' is not yet recognized. If you registered it recently, then it's safe to ignore this warning message. Otherwise, you should set it to your own unique 4 character code, and register it with Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx

<summary>⚠ <b>WARN:</b> Ensure fonts have ScriptLangTags declared on the 'meta' table.</summary>

* [com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

* [com.google.fonts/check/unreachable_glyphs](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/unreachable_glyphs)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Glyphs are either accessible directly through Unicode codepoints or through
substitution rules. Any glyphs not accessible by either of these means are
redundant and serve only to increase the font&#x27;s file size.</pre>

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will only
differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.
However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a display
family.
This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This font has a 'Soft Hyphen' character (codepoint 0x00AD) which is supposed to be zero-width and invisible, and is used to mark a hyphenation possibility within a word in the absence of or overriding dictionary hyphenation. It is mostly an obsolete mechanism now, and the character is only included in fonts for legacy codepage coverage. [code: softhyphen]

This check detects line segments which are nearly, but not quite, exactly
horizontal or vertical. Sometimes such lines are created by design, but often
they are indicative of a design error.

* [com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/meta/script_lang_tags)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
The OpenType &#x27;meta&#x27; table originated at Apple. Microsoft added it to OT with
just two DataMap records:
- dlng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font is designed for
- slng: comma-separated ScriptLangTags that indicate which scripts, or languages
and scripts, with possible variants, the font supports
The slng structure is intended to describe which languages and scripts the font
overall supports. For example, a Traditional Chinese font that also contains
Latin characters, can indicate Hant,Latn, showing that it supports Hant, the
Traditional Chinese variant of the Hani script, and it also supports the Latn
script
The dlng structure is far more interesting. A font may contain various glyphs,
but only a particular subset of the glyphs may be truly &quot;leading&quot; in the design,
while other glyphs may have been included for technical reasons. Such a
Traditional Chinese font could only list Hant there, showing that it’s designed
for Traditional Chinese, but the font would omit Latn, because the developers
don’t think the font is really recommended for purely Latin-script use.
The tags used in the structures can comprise just script, or also language and
script. For example, if a font has Bulgarian Cyrillic alternates in the locl
feature for the cyrl BGR OT languagesystem, it could also indicate in dlng
explicitly that it supports bul-Cyrl. (Note that the scripts and languages in
meta use the ISO language and script codes, not the OpenType ones).
This check ensures that the font has the meta table containing the slng and dlng
structures.
All families in the Google Fonts collection should contain the &#x27;meta&#x27; table.
Windows 10 already uses it when deciding on which fonts to fall back to. The
Google Fonts API and also other environments could use the data for smarter
filtering. Most importantly, those entries should be added to the Noto fonts.
In the font making process, some environments store this data in external files
already. But the meta table provides a convenient way to store this inside the
font file, so some tools may add the data, and unrelated tools may read this
data. This makes the solution much more portable and universal.</pre>

<pre>--- Rationale ---
Glyphs are either accessible directly through Unicode codepoints or through
substitution rules. Any glyphs not accessible by either of these means are
redundant and serve only to increase the font&#x27;s file size.</pre>

* [com.google.fonts/check/contour_count](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/universal.html#com.google.fonts/check/contour_count)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Visually QAing thousands of glyphs by hand is tiring. Most glyphs can only be
constructured in a handful of ways. This means a glyph&#x27;s contour count will only
differ slightly amongst different fonts, e.g a &#x27;g&#x27; could either be 2 or 3
contours, depending on whether its double story or single story.
However, a quotedbl should have 2 contours, unless the font belongs to a display
family.
This check currently does not cover variable fonts because there&#x27;s plenty of
alternative ways of constructing glyphs with multiple outlines for each feature
in a VarFont. The expected contour count data for this check is currently
optimized for the typical construction of glyphs in static fonts.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** This font has a 'Soft Hyphen' character (codepoint 0x00AD) which is supposed to be zero-width and invisible, and is used to mark a hyphenation possibility within a word in the absence of or overriding dictionary hyphenation.

* [com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id](https://font-bakery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fontbakery/profiles/googlefonts.html#com.google.fonts/check/vendor_id)
<pre>--- Rationale ---
Microsoft keeps a list of font vendors and their respective contact info. This
list is updated regularly and is indexed by a 4-char &quot;Vendor ID&quot; which is stored
in the achVendID field of the OS/2 table.
Registering your ID is not mandatory, but it is a good practice since some
applications may display the type designer / type foundry contact info on some
dialog and also because that info will be visible on Microsoft&#x27;s website:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/vendors/
This check verifies whether or not a given font&#x27;s vendor ID is registered in
that list or if it has some of the default values used by the most common font
editors.
Each new FontBakery release includes a cached copy of that list of vendor IDs.
If you registered recently, you&#x27;re safe to ignore warnings emitted by this
check, since your ID will soon be included in one of our upcoming releases.</pre>

* ⚠ **WARN** OS/2 VendorID value 'NONE' is not yet recognized. If you registered it recently, then it's safe to ignore this warning message. Otherwise, you should set it to your own unique 4 character code, and register it with Microsoft at https://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx
